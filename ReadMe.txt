A simple text based UI that can:
Display the user's songs library.  This includes Artist and Album.
The user can insert new songs into the library.  Depending on what knowledge the user has the player can take a song
and artist and fetch the album or given an album fetch the most likely artists to which the user can decide.
Prompt the user for a new song, artist, or album and then fill in any missing data is done through Music Brainz.
The user can also create a new playlist based on if the songs were liked or by a particular artist.  This will be
printed as well as outputed to library.xml.  Since it was done with the aid of maven the lifecycle features allow for
cleaning, compiling, testing, and javadoc generation.
